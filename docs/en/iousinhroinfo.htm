<b>IOU</b> «I Owe You» of the iol Internet of Labor iol-ecosystem/platform»: IOU's idea is that any work done in any location should be worth the same anywhere else. For example, you completed a job in one of the countries for 1 IOU, and this means that you can order the same work anywhere else for 1 IOU. But a problem arises: work in different countries has different costs. To address this issue, the <b>iol</b> (Internet of Labor iol-ecosystem / platform) suggests that 1 IOU should be equal to the minimum (floor) wage per hour at the country of work.
<br><br>
The iol architecture allows users to pay between workers and customers for work using the IOU. At the same time, it can solve local and global problems associated with classical economics.
<br>In essence, the IOU is not any currency or asset. We can consider IOU as <b>Untitled Bearer Bond</b>. Thus, mutual debt repayment is ensured.
<br><br>
IOU cannot be bought or sold in any currency. Thus, a balance of work-price prices is achieved in countries with different economic levels and coordination with local regulations.
<br><br>
But how to buy goods and services for IOU outside the iol ecosystem, given that the cost of goods and services in local currencies is different in different countries?
<br>
To this end, the iol architect provided a mechanism for synchronization between IOU, classic currencies and alternative assets (including cryptocurrency). This mechanism is called <b>SINHRO</b>.
<br><br>
<b>SINHRO</b> provides market cross-validation based on the supply and demand of buyers and sellers in the <b>NiXeL</b> app.
<br><br>
SINHRO does not appear or disappear from anywhere! It is provided only by the really performed work in the iol ecosystem, i.e. in applications running in the iol ecosystem.
<br><br>
SINHRO credits users with 40 IOU after verification in the NiXel app.
<br>
There are three ways SINHRO can occur:
<br><br>
- upon completion of work in applications operating under the iol-franchise license. They are referred to as iol-providers. The amount of SINHRO accrued is 0.6% of the cost of the work performed using the IOU for payment for completed job. SINHRO will be added to your earnings and will not affect the number of IOU users. In the iol ecosystem, this is called SINHRO mining on real work. SINHRO can be exchanged by the user for any currency in the NiXeL system. This allows users to recover the cost of developer royalties as well;
<br><br>
- maining running iol nodes. When a payment transaction goes through a miner node. The amount of mining is inversely proportional to the number of all miners in the region and is 0.005% of the amount of royalties to iol developers.
<br><br>
- iol-providers of the generated in iol-builder iol-apps and launched under iol-franchise licence are able to get fees in SINHRO from the their apps' users.
<br><br>
SINHRO is, in fact, a bot that is responsible for transactions and optimization of estimates and always keeps the current value current for dealers. SINHRO is also designed to prevent manipulation of the exchange in NiXeL. For example, an attacker wanted to influence the current price of SINHRO by trying to sell a small volume of SINHRO by announcing the purchase in advance for less than the others are offering. SINHRO will do it like this: SINHRO will buy from him for his price, sell for the maximum price from those willing. Thus, this will only fix the more expensive cost of SINHRO and, given the provision of SINHRO with actually performed work on all iol providers. So, SINHRO will tend to stable growth.
<br><br>
<b>NiXeL</b> mobile digital document flow system: a special non-commercial iol-provider that is responsible for the identification, authorization and electronic document management of participants in the iol ecosystem. Authorization in applications operating in the iol ecosystem (iol-providers) through NiXeL saves users from re-registering in applications of iol providers. This saves users time and makes it easier to use iol-providers' apps. NiXel support comes from developer royalties of iol.
<br><br>
Also, NiXeL takes over the most complex and power-consuming functions such as using GPS, notifications, using the camera, storing photos and documents, correspondence, electronic signature, etc. This simplifies the use of iol-providers' apps, makes them lighter, saves battery and device memory.
<br><br>
The iol ecosystem uses iolDB. iolDB is a distributed database that runs on <b>BloodVessels</b> technology (temporary name from an author who collaborates with the iol project. BloodVessels can be conventionally called a "multidimensional graph-like blockchain"). It allows us to store and process data in milliseconds without the need for large computing power. It uses the speed of connection and the solve blocks (nodal solutions) based on hard-to-solve graph problems, and not on "iteration" like a blockchain. This allows us to run mining nodes even on weak devices without significantly impacting the performance and power consumption of these devices.
